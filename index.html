    <h2>Sleep</h2>

    <p>Sleep is crucial for everyone, from children to adults, as it supports 
        overall health and well-being. A good night's rest helps the body recover, 
        boosts mood, enhances concentration, and strengthens the immune system. 
        Regardless of age, it's important to get enough sleepâ€”about 7-9 hours for 
        adults, and more for children and teens. Creating a regular sleep routine, 
        avoiding screens before bed, and making your sleep environment comfortable 
        can make a big difference in the quality of your rest and energy levels 
        throughout the day.</p>
